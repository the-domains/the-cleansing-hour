The Story

"The Cleansing Hour" is the
story of two failed actors, Lance and Drew, who have found success running the
internet's ONLY webcast that streams live exorcisms. The catch? They're just
elaborately staged to look real to dupe a believing global audience.But when their latest subject
turns out to actually be demon-possessed, Lance and Drew will be forced to
reckon with their online charade-- live in front of more than 20 million
viewers.
